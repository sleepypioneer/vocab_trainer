Vocabulary trainer App

A offline accessible Progressive Web App for training vocabulary through flash cards where the user types an answer.

It is possible to add your own vocabulary and save these lists to the local storage (IndexedDB). A user account can also be saved to track the score count.

Vocabulary lists can be downloaded from the main DB and are then editable. However currently user data is not pushed to the main Data base and is only saved locally.

A timer is inlcuded for timed sessions and goal setting.

Sound FX and styling choices (Night learning mode) can be changed on the account page.

When viewed on larger screens this site points to the development page for this App.
